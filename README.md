# Effective Java Examples

The source code contained herein is from the book "Effective Java Second Edition" by Joshua Bloch.

All sources are nearly unchanged, only the package names where adjusted.

The source code was originally available from http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/index.html, by now the URL turns out to not lead to the desired source code anymore.

# Java and Rust

While reading the book, I will see how given design patterns are translating into the Rust world, and
will add the respective code here using various cargo projects.
